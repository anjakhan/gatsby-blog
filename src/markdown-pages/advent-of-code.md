### Time for some coding fun

In December 2020 I successfully refrained from any kind of chocolate advent calenders. I substituted them with a whole series of coding challenges from the Advent of Code 2020. In the beginning I surprisingly did quite well, but with the days passing it got more difficult for me as a beginner in programming to handle such algorithmic tasks. Until 20th of December I challenged myself about every day. Though it took more and more time to solve the puzzles and I ended up spending less time with my family. Nevertheless, the Advent of Code was a great experience and I definetly learned a lot and worked on my programming skills. It was great fun and I surely will try myself on the next years Advent calendar.
