[The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course by Andrei Neagoie, Founder and Lead Instructor of the [Zero To Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/) was a very big and challenging course I took to work my path towards becoming a Fullstack Developer. Some of my tasks completed during this course are:

* [React Robofriends](https://anjakhan.github.io/robofriends/)
