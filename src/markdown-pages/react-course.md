### Complete React Developer in 2021 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)

I successfully finished the [Complete React Developer in 2021 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course by Andrei Neagoie and with that gained a whole new set of programming skills. Among others React Router, Redux, Redux Saga, Asynchronous Redux, React Hooks, Context API, React Suspense, React Lazy, Firebase, Styled-Components, GraphQL, PWAs, Persistance, Session Storage and more. Along the way I built an e-commerce application called crwn-clothing, a full stack app (MERN stack) using Firebase.

Check out the result:
