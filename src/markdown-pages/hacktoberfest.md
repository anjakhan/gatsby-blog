October was Hacktoberfest time. A time for me to take up some challenges and do fun coding. The Hacktoberfest encouraged me to participate in challenges of different communities like [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) and the [Zero To Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/). I definitely improved my coding skills along the way and besides got a nice break from following udemy courses. Now I can't wait for Advent of Code to come and see if I am fit for the next level of coding ...

Tasks completed during Hacktoberfest were:

* Coding Train Challenges
    * [TicTacToe Game](https://anjakhan.github.io/TicTacToe_Challenge/)
    * [Post Covid Flights](https://anjakhan.github.io/PostCovidFlights_Challenge/)
* ZTM Challenges
    * [Hacktober Confetti](https://canvas-creations.netlify.app/art/anjakhan/)
        * [ZTM Canvas Creation Projects](https://canvas-creations.netlify.app/)
    * [Quote Generator](https://anjakhan.github.io/quote-generator/)
