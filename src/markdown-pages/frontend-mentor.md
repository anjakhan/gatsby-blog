### Contributions to the Frontend Mentor Community

Whilst working on my coding skills and following along with [The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course I took up my first challenges in April/May 2020. I joined the [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/dashboard) and started looking out for some exciting beginner challenges. I started out with a [social media dashboard](https://anjakhan.github.io/social-media-dashboard/) that includes a theme switcher for light and dark mode. My second task was more demanding for me as a beginner. I created a [Rock Paper Scissors](https://anjakhan.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/index.html) game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flexbox. The challenges were fun to do and got me the first motivational comment on my work.
