### My failure and success in attending a technical assessment

By now it has been about three years of learning Web Development and I have come a long way of struggles, failures, fun hackathon and great accomplishments. I created a variety of apps and always increased my skills. Besides I have started to gain more knowledge on the things happening behind the scenes and learn the concepts of advanced JavaScript. At this point I felt ready to step into the real world and start applying for some jobs. 

I ended up sitting infront of my first technical assessment and breaking into thousand pieces. I expected an algorithmic test as the whole website and statements from other people indicated, but had to do a react task, which in general I am able to handle, though the task was beyond my skills. Up this point I never worked with axios or lodash and the time was running, 120 minutes in total. I reached shameful 0%. To get back my confidence and upgrade my skills I worked on a new application to not only display all my [GitHub Repos](https://ak-github-repos.netlify.app/) in a more picturesque way, but also to catch up on what I should have known for the technical assessment to pass. 

So next time I hopefully won't panic and loose time but take it step by step as I usually do when working on my apps...
